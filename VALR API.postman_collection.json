		"description": "VALR provides a powerful API consisting of REST endpoints for transactional operations and a complementary WebSocket service providing streaming market, order, and balance updates.\n\nAccess to and use of the API is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://support.valr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019021931-Terms-of-Service).\n\nIf you have any API questions, feedback, or recommendations please post a question via our [support center](https://support.valr.com/).\n\nWith our API, you can:\n\n- Access current and historic market data\n    \n- Submit trade orders\n    \n- Buy and sell over 60 cryptocurrencies\n    \n- Withdraw cryptocurrencies from your wallets\n    \n- Withdraw fiat from your VALR wallet\n    \n\n# Getting started\n\n---\n\nKeep the following in mind when developing against the VALR API:\n\n- Enable 2FA on your account. API Keys cannot be generated unless 2FA is enabled.\n    \n- All REST requests must be sent using the `application/json` content-type. Non-HTTPS requests are not allowed.\n    \n- All REST requests will result in HTTP response codes in the range 200-299, unless there is a server or infrastructure error. The API result will be wrapped in a JSON Result object.\n    \n- Receiving a response with an ID does not necessarily mean the order has been placed. If the response status is 202 Accepted, check the order status using either the Order Status REST API or the WebSocket API for real-time updates.\n    \n- Requests that are made to the Authenticated API without an API key will be rejected with an HTTP response code `403`.\n    \n- Any `POST`, `PUT` or `PATCH` HTTP request that is made without the `content-type: application/json` header will be rejected with an HTTP response code `403`.\n    \n\n# AI Support\n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/369aa252-eff4-4c40-9a96-228e06b703e5/YXNrLWFpLnBuZw==\">\n\nTo explore our docs with AI support, [<b>CLICK HERE</b>](https://support.valr.com/hc/en-us?askai=true).\n\n# Authentication\n\n---\n\n## API Keys\n\nAuthenticating to the VALR API requires a valid API Key. API Keys have scoped permissions:\n\n- **View access** - This option grants the API Key permission only to view balances, orders, and other details of the account.\n    \n- **Trade** - This option grants the API Key permission to place buy and sell orders.\n    \n- **Transfer** - This option grants the API Key permission to transfer funds between primary and subaccounts.\n    \n- **Withdraw** - This option grants the API Key permission to programatically withdraw a currency to an address or a bank account you provide.\n    \n- **Link Bank Account** - This option grants the API Key permission to programmatically link bank accounts for fiat deposits and withdrawals.\n    \n\nIf you have enabled 2FA you can view existing API Keys or generate new API Keys with the appropriate permissions. Find the `API Keys` in the account drop-down menu. We strongly recommend minimizing the scope of any given API key to limit the impact of a compromised key/secret pair.\n\nThe generated API Key and the corresponding secret are each 64-character long and are made up of numbers and letters. An API Key/API Secret will look similar to the example provided below:\n\nExample API Key/API Secret: `b9fb68df5485639d03c3171cf6e49b89e52fd78d5c313819b9c592b59c689f33`\n\n### Notes on security: Secure your API Keys and API Secrets\n\nYour API Key identifies your account (think of it as a username) and the API Secret authenticates your account (think of it as a password). Please follow the instructions below to secure your API Key and API Secret:\n\n- Do not send your API Secret with your API requests. Only send the API Key.\n    \n- Do not share your API Secret or the API Key with anyone.\n    \n- Do not commit your API Secret into source control systems like github.\n    \n- If you lose your API Key or Secret, immediately delete it from your Setting page.\n    \n\nPlease take note that if your API Secret is compromised, your funds are at risk.\n\n## Request signing\n\nAuthenticated calls require you to send a request signature with every request. This signature should be re-generated for every request. The `request signature` is generated by first concatenating the following values in the order given below and creating a SHA512 HMAC hash using your API Secret:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| timestamp | The current unix timestamp (in milliseconds) of this request |\n| verb | HTTP verb. Example: GET, POST, PUT or DELETE |\n| path | Request path excluding host name and including query string, e.g. /v1/account/balances |\n| body (optional) | HTTP Request body as a string (optional, if request has no body) |\n| subaccountId (optional) | The Id of a subaccount as a string. **Required when impersonating a subaccount.** |\n\nThe NodeJS example below has a method called `signRequest` that generates a `request signature` which must be passed along with every request that needs authentication:\n\n``` javascript\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\nfunction signRequest(apiSecret, timestamp, verb, path, body = '') {\n    return crypto\n      .createHmac(\"sha512\", apiSecret)\n      .update(timestamp.toString())\n      .update(verb.toUpperCase())\n      .update(path)\n      .update(body)\n      .digest(\"hex\");\n}\n\n ```\n\nGolang example:\n\n``` go\nfunc signRequest(apiSecret string, timestamp time.Time, verb string, path string, body string) string {\n    // Create a new Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) using SHA512 and API Secret\n    mac := hmac.New(sha512.New, []byte(apiSecret))\n    // Convert timestamp to nanoseconds then divide by 1000000 to get the milliseconds\n    timestampString := strconv.FormatInt(timestamp.UnixNano()/1000000, 10)\n    mac.Write([]byte(timestampString))\n    mac.Write([]byte(strings.ToUpper(verb)))\n    mac.Write([]byte(path))\n    mac.Write([]byte(body))\n    // Gets the byte hash from HMAC and converts it into a hex string\n    return hex.EncodeToString(mac.Sum(nil))\n}\n\n ```\n\nC# example:\n\n``` csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Security.Cryptography;\npublic static \nstring signRequest(string apiKeySecret, string timestamp, string verb, string path, string body = \"\")\n{\n    var payload = timestamp + verb.ToUpper() + path + body;\n    byte[] payloadBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(payload);\n    using (HMACSHA512 hmac = new HMACSHA512(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(apiKeySecret))) \n    {\n        byte[] hash = hmac.ComputeHash(payloadBytes);\n        return toHexString(hash);\n    }\n}\nprivate static \nstring toHexString(byte[] hash)\n{\n    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(hash.Length * 2);\n    foreach(var b in hash)\n    {\n        result.Append(b.ToString(\"x2\"));\n    }\n    return result.ToString();\n}\n/* Timestamp in milliseconds. \n * The same timestamp should be used to generate request signature\n * as well as sent along in the X-VALR-TIMESTAMP header of the request\n */\nprivate static \nstring getTimestamp()\n{\n    return DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds().ToString();\n}\n\n ```\n\nPython 3.x example:\n\n``` python\nimport time\nimport hashlib\nimport hmac\ndef sign_request(api_key_secret, timestamp, verb, path, body = \"\"):\n    \"\"\"Signs the request payload using the api key secret\n    api_key_secret - the api key secret\n    timestamp - the unix timestamp of this request e.g. int(time.time()*1000)\n    verb - Http verb - GET, POST, PUT or DELETE\n    path - path excluding host name, e.g. '/v1/withdraw\n    body - http request body as a string, optional\n    \"\"\"\n    payload = \"{}{}{}{}\".format(timestamp,verb.upper(),path,body)\n    message = bytearray(payload,'utf-8')\n    signature = hmac.new( bytearray(api_key_secret,'utf-8'), message, digestmod=hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()\n    return signature\n\n ```\n\nJava example:\n\n``` java\nimport javax.crypto.Mac;\nimport javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;\nimport java.security.InvalidKeyException;\nimport java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;\nimport java.time.Clock;\n    /**\n     * Signs the request payload using the api key secret\n     *\n     * @param apiKeySecret - the api key secret\n     * @param timestamp    - the unix timestamp of this request e.g. Clock.systemUTC().millis()\n     * @param verb         - Http verb - GET, POST, PUT or DELETE\n     * @param path         - path excluding host name, e.g. '/v1/withdraw'\n     * @param body         - http request body as a string, optional\n     * @return the signature of the request\n     */\n    public static String signRequest(String apiKeySecret, String timestamp, String verb, String path, String body) {\n        try {\n            Mac hmacSHA512 = Mac.getInstance(\"HmacSHA512\");\n            SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(apiKeySecret.getBytes(), \"HmacSHA512\");\n            hmacSHA512.init(secretKeySpec);\n            hmacSHA512.update(timestamp.getBytes());\n            hmacSHA512.update(verb.toUpperCase().getBytes());\n            hmacSHA512.update(path.getBytes());\n            hmacSHA512.update(body.getBytes());\n            byte[] digest = hmacSHA512.doFinal();\n            return toHexString(digest);\n        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | InvalidKeyException e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"Unable to sign request\", e);\n        }\n    }\n    public static String toHexString(byte[] a) {\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(a.length * 2);\n        for (byte b : a)\n            sb.append(String.format(\"\u0002x\", b));\n        return sb.toString();\n    }\n\n ```\n\n### Writing your own request signing method\n\nIf you choose to write your own method to generate a `request signature`, please use the following test data:\n\n| Parameter | Test value |\n| --- | --- |\n| timestamp | 1558014486185 |\n| verb | GET |\n| path | /v1/account/balances |\n| API Secret | 4961b74efac86b25cce8fbe4c9811c4c7a787b7a5996660afcc2e287ad864363 |\n\nIf you provide the above values, your method should generate the following HMAC SHA512 signature using your API Secret:\n\n`9d52c181ed69460b49307b7891f04658e938b21181173844b5018b2fe783a6d4c62b8e67a03de4d099e7437ebfabe12c56233b73c6a0cc0f7ae87e05f6289928`\n\n| Parameter | Test value |\n| --- | --- |\n| timestamp | 1558017528946 |\n| verb | POST |\n| path | /v1/orders/market |\n| body | {\"customerOrderId\":\"ORDER-000001\",\"pair\":\"BTCUSDC\",\"side\":\"BUY\",\"quoteAmount\":\"80000\"} |\n| API Secret | 4961b74efac86b25cce8fbe4c9811c4c7a787b7a5996660afcc2e287ad864363 |\n\nIf you provide the above values, your method should generate the following HMAC SHA512 signature using your API Secret:\n\n`09f536e3dfdad58443f16010a97a0a21ad27486b7b8d6d4103170d885410ed77f037f1fa628474190d4f5c08ca12c1acc850901f1c2e75c6d906ec3b32b008d0`\n\n## Making an authenticated API call\n\nFollow the instructions below to make an authenticated API call:\n\n1. Create a SHA512 HMAC hash using your API Secret and the values pertaining to your request (timestamp, HTTP verb, API path, body, subaccountId - when impersonating a subaccount) detailed above.\n    \n2. REST: Include the following headers in each request:\n    \n    - **X-VALR-API-KEY** : Your API Key\n        \n    - **X-VALR-SIGNATURE** : The `request signature` that was generated for your request (see point 1)\n        \n    - **X-VALR-TIMESTAMP** : The same timestamp used to generate the `request signature`\n        \n    - **X-VALR-SUB-ACCOUNT-ID** (Optional): A Primary account API key can impersonate a subaccount by specifying the subaccountId in this header. This allows the primary account to transact on the impersonated subaccount. Remember to add the subaccountId in the request signature as well.\n        \n3. WebSocket: Pass in the same three headers to the first call that establishes the WebSocket connection. (See `WebSocket API` section below for details)\n    \n\n## Run in Postman\n\nYou can run our API collection in Postman using the button \"Run in Postman\" above. This collection already includes the following items for your convenience:\n\n1. A pre-request script that runs before every request to generate your request signature and timestamp.\n    \n2. The three authentication headers pre-populated with the right environment variables for each request.\n    \n\nIn order to start with Postman, please create a new `Environment` in Postman and add two variables and name them `yourApiKey` and `yourApiSecret`. Provide appropriate initial values for these variables. That is, your Api Key and Api Secret for your account. Enable this environment while running your requests. That is all!\n\n(Optional): To impersonate an account add the **X-VALR-SUB-ACCOUNT-ID** header to the request. To add the **X-VALR-SUB-ACCOUNT-ID** header to **every** request, define the `yourSubAccountId` variable in your `Environment`. If you provide the header on the request and **also** define the environment variable, the header will take precedence. Note that some requests do not allow impersonation.\n\n### Details of the pre-request script\n\nThe pre-request script will populate the following two variables in your environment with the correct values:\n\n- `requestSignature`\n    \n- `requestTimestamp`\n    \n\nThe script is provided below for your convenience:\n\n``` javascript\n/* Pre-requisite\n==================\n1) Create a new Environment in Postman.\n2) Add two variables: \"yourApiKey\" and \"yourApiSecret\" to the Environment. Provide appropriate initial values for these variables. That is, the Api Key and Api Secret for your account.\n3) Enable this environment for your requests.\n4) For each request, this script generates the following two new environment variables:\n* requestSignature\n* requestTimestamp\n5) Ensure that the following three headers are sent with every request:\nX-VALR-API-KEY: {{yourApiKey}}\nX-VALR-SIGNATURE: {{requestSignature}}\nX-VALR-TIMESTAMP: {{requestTimestamp}}\nSubaccounts\n==================\nTo perform a request impersonating a specific subaccount, the subaccount ID must be provided. The ID can be determined by using `Account/Subaccounts/Retrieve Subaccounts`. Once the ID is determined, it can be added to the request by either adding the `X-VALR-SUB-ACCOUNT-ID` header, with the ID as value, to the request directly, or by adding the variable {{yourSubAccountId}} to the Postman Environment. If both are provided, the header has precedence. If the variable is provided it will be added to every request.\nPlease note: Requests that may only be performed on the Primary account will fail with a \"401: Unauthorized\" response if the subaccount ID is included.\n*/\nvar YOUR_API_KEY = postman.getEnvironmentVariable('yourApiKey');\nvar YOUR_API_SECRET = postman.getEnvironmentVariable('yourApiSecret');\nvar subAccountHeader = pm.request.headers.find((header) => header.key === 'X-VALR-SUB-ACCOUNT-ID' && !header.disabled)\nvar YOUR_SUB_ACCOUNT_ID = subAccountHeader ? subAccountHeader.value \n        : postman.getEnvironmentVariable('yourSubAccountId');\nvar requestTimestamp = (new Date()).getTime();\nfunction getPath(url) {\n    var pathRegex = /(?:.+?\\:\\/\\/.+?)?(\\/.+)/;\n    var result = url.match(pathRegex);\n    return result && result.length > 1 ? result[1] : ''; \n}\nfunction getHmacDigest(httpMethod, requestUrl, requestBody) {\n    var requestPath = getPath(requestUrl.toString());\n    if (httpMethod == 'GET' || !requestBody) {\n        requestBody = ''; \n    } \n    var requestData = [requestTimestamp, httpMethod.toUpperCase(), requestPath, requestBody, YOUR_SUB_ACCOUNT_ID].join(\"\");\n    var hmacDigest = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.stringify(CryptoJS.HmacSHA512(requestData, YOUR_API_SECRET));\n    return hmacDigest;\n}\npostman.setEnvironmentVariable('requestSignature', getHmacDigest(pm.request.method, pm.request.url, pm.request.body));\npostman.setEnvironmentVariable('requestTimestamp', requestTimestamp);\nif (YOUR_SUB_ACCOUNT_ID && YOUR_SUB_ACCOUNT_ID > 0 && !subAccountHeader) {\n    pm.request.headers.add({ key: 'X-VALR-SUB-ACCOUNT-ID', value: `${YOUR_SUB_ACCOUNT_ID}` });\n}j\n\n ```\n\n# Rate limiting\n\n---\n\nThere is an API call limit of 2000 API calls per minute per API key, and 1200 API calls per minute per IP, beyond which the API calls will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests` response. A response header of `x-valr-ratelimited: true` will also be returned. The limit will be reset at the start of the next minute.\n\n- Example 1: You are allowed to do 1000 calls from 10:10:00 to 10:10:59. When the time changes to 10:11:00, the counter will be reset and will start over.\n    \n- Example 2: If the first request comes in at 10:10:30, the counter will be reset at 10:11:00\n    \n\nTo ensure that users are able to place and cancel orders at a higher rate, per second rate limits are applied on certain API routes, with the limit reset at the start of the next second. Here the limits per IP and key do not apply:\n\n- Public calls v1:\n    \n    - Route: /v1/public/\\*\n        \n    - Method: `GET`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 30/m\n        \n- Public time v1:\n    \n    - Route: /v1/public/time\n        \n    - Method: `GET`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 20/s\n        \n- Public status v1:\n    \n    - Route: /v1/public/status\n        \n    - Method: `GET`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 20/s\n        \n- Public buckets v1:\n    \n    - Route: /v1/public/\\*/buckets\n        \n    - Method: `GET`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 20/s\n        \n- Batch orders v1:\n    \n    - Route /v1/batch/orders\n        \n    - Method: `POST`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 400/s\n        \n- Delete orders v1:\n    \n    - Route /v1/orders\n        \n    - Method: `DELETE`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 450/s\n        \n- Post orders v1:\n    \n    - Route /v1/orders\n        \n    - Method: `POST`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 400/s\n        \n- Batch orders v2:\n    \n    - Route /v2/orders/modify\n        \n    - Method: `PUT`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 400/s\n        \n- Loans v1:\n    \n    - Route /v1/loans/\\*\n        \n    - Method: `POST, PUT, DELETE`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 1/s\n        \n- Create sub account v1:\n    \n    - Route /v1/account/subaccount\n        \n    - Method: `POST`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 1/s\n        \n- Sub account transfer v1:\n    \n    - Route /v1/account/subaccount/transfer\n        \n    - Method: `POST`\n        \n    - Rate limit: 20/s\n        \n- WebSocket new clients:\n    \n    - Route: /ws\n        \n    - Rate limit: 60/m\n        \n- WebSocket account write:\n    \n    - Route: /ws/account\n        \n    - Place: 400 p/s\n        \n    - Cancel: 450p/s\n        \n    - Batch: 400p/s\n        \n    - Modify: 400p/s\n        \n\nWe may reduce limits when the system is under severe pressure.\n\n# Performance considerations\n\n---\n\n### WebSocket Efficiency\n\nWebSocket connections offer significantly faster data transmission than HTTP due to their persistent, open TCP socket. This allows for efficient, real-time communication.  \nBatching can further enhance performance, though the benefit is less pronounced with WebSockets compared to HTTP.\n\n### Optimal Order Book Updates\n\nThe OB_L1_DIFF WebSocket feed provides the most rapid updates for order book changes. Its smaller data packets minimize overhead for clients, servers, and network transmission.\n\n### Real-Time Order Execution\n\nA WebSocket connection is the fastest method for receiving order processing and status updates. Most unfiltered HTTP requests for order status are served from memory, but updates via WebSockets in normal conditions should still be superior.\n\n### Estimated Latency\n\nExcluding geographic distance and demand, the total round trip time from placing the order via WebSocket to receiving the order place outcome on a WebSocket connection should be approximately 8ms. This number is a rough estimate and can vary as we constantly update our service or due to other constraints.\n\n# Caching\n\nIn order to improve the latency of requests and reduce the load on servers, some GET requests are cached by default.  \nWe use the HTTP Cache-Control Header, which comprises one or more comma separated directives. These directives determine whether a GET response is cachable, and if so, the duration.\n\nHere's an example of an HTTP Response Header:\n\n`cache-control: max-age=60,public`\n\n- cache-control: max-age - defines the amount of time it takes for a cached copy of a resource to expire, in seconds.\n    \n- cache-control: public - means that a resource can be cached by any cache.\n    \n\nBelow are the GET endpoints that are cached, and their max-age in seconds.\n\n```\n*Public Routes*\n===============\n/marketsummary (60)\n/:currencypair/marketsummary (10)\n/currencies (60)\n/pairs(60)\n/:currencyPair/orderbook (30)\n/:currencyPair/orderbook/full (30)\n/:currencyPair/trades (30)\n/ordertypes (60)\n/:currencypair/ordertypes (60)\n*Authenticated Routes*\n======================\n/marketdata (1)\n/fiat/:currency/banks (600)\n/fiat/:currency/auto-buy (60)\n/portfolio (1)\n\n ```",

Each bucket provides the open, high, low, close, and volume for the defined time interval.\n\n**Note:** If no trading activity occurred during a specific bucket period, the `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` prices will be identical (likely reflecting the last traded price), and `volume` and `quoteVolume` will be zero.\n\nValid inputs for the `periodsSeconds` parameter are `60 (default) - 1 Minute`, `300 - 5 Minutes`, `900 - 15 Minutes`, `1800 - 30 Minutes`, `3600 - 1 Hour`, `21600 - 6 Hours` and `86400 - 1 Day (max)`"

								"description": "Transaction history for all your sub accounts.\n\nThe results of this request may be filtered by transaction types, currency and start and end time. The `skip` and `limit` parameters may be applied to paginate the filtered results.\n\nPlease note that all transactions that are returned using the provided filter criteria will be ordered by the date the transactions were created in **descending** order.\n\n## Filtering by `skip` or `limit`\n\nPaginate the query results by skipping the `skip` newest results, and limiting the results to `limit` records. The default value of `skip`, if omitted, is `0`, and the default value of `limit` is `100`. The maximum allowed value of limit is `200`.\n\n## Filtering by `startTime` or `endTime`\n\nThe `startTime` or `endTime` parameters may be used to filter the returned items by the transaction date. The parameters will be interpreted as being in the UTC time zone and must be supplied in the ISO 8601 format (`2020-02-29T22:00:00.000Z`). These two parameters may be used together or separately. When `startTime` is used, transactions that have occurred since `startTime` are returned. When `endTime` is used, transactions that have occurred up to and including `endTime` are returned.\n\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n\n- When `startTime` and `endTime` are not provided the `startTime` will be defaulted to 1 day before current time and `endTime` will be defaulted to current time.\n    \n- When `startTime` is specified and `endTime` is not specified, `endTime` will be defaulted to 7 days after `startTime`, to a maximum of current time.\n    \n- When `startTime` is not specified and `endTime` is specified, `startTime` will be defaulted to 7 days prior to `endTime`.\n    \n- `startTime` and `endTime` may not differ by more than 7 days.    \n\n__NOTE__\nThe `startTime` and `endTime` parameters are optional filters. However, omitting these parameters may result in slower response times. To mitigate this, a default time window such as the most recent 30 days may be automatically applied to the request.\n\n## Filtering by `transactionTypes`\n\nThe `transactionTypes` parameter may be used to filter the returned items by a comma-separated list of transaction types from the following list of supported types:\n\n- LIMIT_BUY\n    \n- LIMIT_SELL\n    \n- MARKET_BUY\n    \n- MARKET_SELL\n    \n- SIMPLE_BUY\n    \n- SIMPLE_SELL\n    \n- AUTO_BUY\n    \n- MAKER_REWARD\n    \n- BLOCKCHAIN_RECEIVE\n    \n- BLOCKCHAIN_SEND\n    \n- FIAT_DEPOSIT\n    \n- FIAT_WITHDRAWAL\n    \n- REFERRAL_REBATE\n    \n- REFERRAL_REWARD\n    \n- PROMOTIONAL_REBATE\n    \n- INTERNAL_TRANSFER\n    \n- FIAT_WITHDRAWAL_REVERSAL\n    \n- PAYMENT_SENT\n    \n- PAYMENT_RECEIVED\n    \n- PAYMENT_REVERSED\n    \n- PAYMENT_REWARD\n    \n- OFF_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_WITHDRAW\n    \n- OFF_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_DEPOSIT\n    \n- AUTO_BUY\n    \n- SIMPLE_SWAP_BUY\n    \n- SIMPLE_SWAP_SELL\n    \n- SIMPLE_SWAP_FAILURE_REVERSAL\n    \n\n## Filtering by `currency`\n\nThe `currency` parameter may be used to filter the returned items by the currency symbol (Example: `USDC`, `BTC` etc.). Results will include transactions where the `creditCurrency` or the `debitCurrency` matches this parameter."

It will include transactions where the `creditCurrency` or the `debitCurrency` matches this parameter.\n\n## Filtering by `startTime` or `endTime`\n\nThe `startTime` or `endTime` parameters may be used to filter the returned items by the transaction date. The parameters will be interpreted as being in the UTC time zone and must be supplied in the ISO 8601 format (`2020-02-29T22:00:00.000Z`). These two parameters may be used together or separately. When `startTime` is used, transactions that have occurred since `startTime` are returned. When `endTime` is used, transactions that have occurred up to and including `endTime` are returned.\n\n__NOTE__\nThe `startTime` and `endTime` parameters are optional filters. However, omitting these parameters may result in slower response times. To mitigate this, a default time window such as the most recent 30 days may be automatically applied to the request."

The max length for the `paymentReference` is 256 characters.\n\n**Withdrawal using an address:**\n\n- Network Type\n    \n    - `networkType` is a request field that can be optionally supplied to specify the network that should used for the withdrawal. It is very important to make sure that the `networkType` supplied corresponds to the withdrawal `address` supplied. In cases where the incorrect `networkType` is supplied for an `address` it may result in loss of funds.\n        \n        If `networkType` is not specified, it will be defaulted based on the configuration for the currency that can be found at `/v1/public/currencies`\n        \n- Beneficiary Information\n    \n    - `beneficiaryName`, `isCorporate`, `isSelfHosted`, `serviceProviderId` and `serviceProviderName` are new fields to support the collection of the beneficiary's (recipient's) information. This information will be mandatory after 30 April 2025 is accordance with South Africa regulation that governs crypto asset service providers like VALR.\n        \n\nPlease also consult the supporting documentation for the `/v1/public/currencies` API which illustrates different network type scenarios.\n\n**Withdrawal using an addressBookId:**\n\n- Network Type\n    \n    - When doing a withdrawal by using an `addressBookId`, `networkType` does not need to be specified as the `networkType` of the addressBook entry will be used.\n        \n- Beneficiary Information\n    \n    - Provided that the address book has beneficiary information saved, beneficiary related fields do not need to be supplied in the withdrawal request.\n        \n    - If the address book DOES NOT have beneficiary information stored, you can update it via our web and mobile clients, or supply the information in the same way one would when performing a withdrawal to an address.\n        \n    - `beneficiaryName`, `isCorporate`, `isSelfHosted`, `serviceProviderId` and `serviceProviderName` are new fields to support the collection of the beneficiary's (recipient's) information. This information will be mandatory after 30 April 2025, in accordance with South African regulations that govern crypto asset service providers like VALR.\n        \n\n**Borrowing:**  \nUse the `allowBorrow` option to borrow funds against assets in your account. Collateral is locked while the loan is outstanding. Interest accrues hourly and is capitalised into the loan. You can repay the loan whenever you prefer. Crypto Loans are only available in margin-enabled Subaccounts.\n\n**The Request Body**\n\nAn example of the request body is as follows:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"amount\": \"0.0005\",\n    \"address\": \"2N1rvRDR3fUD6L43QxG5Awy8RHC8nCavAnc\",\n    \"networkType\": \"Bitcoin\",\n    \"allowBorrow\": false,\n    \"beneficiaryName\": \"Satoshi Nakamoto\",\n    \"isCorporate\": false,\n    \"isSelfHosted\": false,\n    \"serviceProviderId\": \"6720c583142afc3bc573c133\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n| **Parameter** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `amount` (required) | The amount (in `:currencyCode` currency) |\n| `address` (required if `addressBookId` not used) | The address to which the crypto will be sent. Either `address` or `addressBookId` must be provided. See examples below. |\n| `addressBookId` (required if `address` not used) | The unique identifier of an address book entry that will be used for the withdrawal. Either `addressBookId` or `address` must be provided. See examples below. |\n| `networkType` (optional) | Specifies the network that should used for the withdrawal. See note above on `networkType` usage and considerations. |\n| `allowBorrow` (optional) | `true` or `false`. Default value is `false`. See description above. |\n| `beneficiaryName` (required \\*) | The full name of the recipient of the withdrawal.  <br>  <br>\\* This is required if using `address`. When using `addressBookId` this can be omitted provided the address book already has this information saved. |\n| `isCorporate` (required \\*) | `true` if the recipient is a legal entity / business. `false` if the recipient is a person.  <br>  <br>\\* This is required if using `address`. When using `addressBookId` this can be omitted provided the address book already has this information saved. |\n| `isSelfHosted` (required \\*) | `true` if the recipient has control of their own keys. `false` if the recipient uses another crypto asset service provider (exchange).  <br>  <br>\\* This is required if using `address`.

Default value is `false` |\n| customerOrderId (optional) | Alphanumeric value. See below for explanation. |\n| timeInForce (optional) | Can be `GTC`, `FOK` or `IOC`. `(should be upper case)`Default value is `GTC`. See below for explanation |\n| allowMargin (optional) | `true` or `false`. Default value is `false`. See below for explanation. |\n| reduceOnly (optional) | `true` or `false`. Default value is `false`. See below for explanation. |\n| conditionalOrderData (optional) | Used on futures pairs to manage exposure through adding a Take Profit and/or Stop Loss (TPSL) to the order. See below for explanation. |\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe `customerOrderId` is an optional field which can be specified by clients to track this order using their own internal order management systems. It supports alphanumeric characters and dashes (\"-\"), with a 50-character limit. Special characters are not allowed. The `customerOrderId` must be **unique across all open orders** for a given account. Reusing an `id` from an active order will prevent the new order from being placed (use the order status API to check an order’s status).\n\n- **`timeInForce`**:  \n    Defines how long an order remains active:\n    \n    - `GTC`: Good Till Cancelled\n        \n    - `FOK`: Fill or Kill\n        \n    - `IOC`: Immediate or Cancel\n        \n- **`allowMargin`**:  \n    Set to `true` for margin/leverage trades. Only subaccounts can trade on margin, and each must be enabled individually via the account/status API.\n    \n- **`reduceOnly`**:\n    \n- Set to `true` for Perpetual Futures order(s) where the limit order should only ever reduce a position, never create or increase.\n    \n- **`conditionalOrderData`**:  \n    Conditional orders are used to add Take Profit and Stop Loss (TPSL) conditions to manage your futures Perpetual Futures order(s). These fields are used to define the conditions under which the TPSL will trigger, and how the order will be placed when triggered.\n    \n    The key thing to note is that you do not need the `linkedOrderId` or `pair` because it refers to the limit order that you are placing.\n    \n    More information can be found in the [Conditional Orders Section](https://docs.valr.com/#8ab83b51-a0f7-405e-bc6b-b7e7f049544b).\n    \n- **Order Retrieval**:  \n    When fetching open or historical orders, the `customerOrderId` (if specified during creation) and VALR's `orderId` will be returned.\n    \n- **Order Cancellation**:  \n    Use either `orderId` or `customerOrderId` to cancel an order—**not both**.\n    \n\n**Fee currency**\n\n- If you are a Maker and you are Buying BTC with USDC, your reward will be paid in USDC\n    \n- If you are a Maker and you are Selling BTC for USDC, your reward will be paid in BTC\n    \n- If you are a Taker and you are Buying BTC with USDC, your fee will be charged in BTC\n    \n- If you are a Taker and you are Selling BTC for USDC, your fee will be charged in USDC\n    \n\nIn short, fees will be in the currency that the taker is receiving and the maker is paying in the trade. The following example uses the `BTCUSDC` trading pair:\n\n| BTC/ZAR | MAKER | TAKER | FEE/REWARD CURRENCY |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TRADE SIDE | BUY | SELL | USDC |\n| TRADE SIDE | SELL | BUY | BTC |\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: When you receive a response with an id, it does not always mean that the order has been placed. When the response is `202 Accepted`, you can use the Order Status REST API or use WebSocket API to receive the status of this order. The reasons why an order could fail are as follows:\n\n- Insufficient balance in your account.\n    \n- If you're using a non-unique `customerOrderId`.\n    \n- If you set `postOnly` flag to true, but your order would have matched immediately.\n    \n- Self trading: If your order matches against your own order (on the other side).\n    \n- Insufficient liquidity: If you're placing an order and there isn't liquidity to fulfill the order."

Please see Public/Order Types. |\n| postOnly (optional) | `postOnly=true` will place a Maker order and cause it to fail if matched immediately. Default value is `false` |\n| customerOrderId (optional) | Alphanumeric value. See below for explanation. |\n| timeInForce (optional) | Can be `GTC`, `FOK` or `IOC`. `(should be upper case)`Default value is `GTC`. See below for explanation |\n| allowMargin (optional) | `true` or `false`. Default value is `false`. See below for explanation. |\n| reduceOnly (optional) | `true` or `false`. Default value is `false`. See below for explanation. |\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe `customerOrderId` is an optional field which can be specified by clients to track this order using their own internal order management systems. It supports alphanumeric characters  with a 50-character limit. Special characters are not allowed. The `customerOrderId` must be **unique across all open orders** for a given account. Reusing an `id` from an active order will prevent the new order from being placed (use the order status API to check an order’s status).\n    \n- **`timeInForce`**:  \n    Defines how long an order remains active:\n    \n    - `GTC`: Good Till Cancelled\n        \n    - `FOK`: Fill or Kill\n        \n    - `IOC`: Immediate or Cancel\n        \n- **`allowMargin`**:  \n    Set to `true` for margin/leverage trades. Only subaccounts can trade on margin, and each must be enabled individually via the account/status API.\n\n- **`reduceOnly`**:\n- Set to `true` for Perpetual Futures order(s) where the limit order should only ever reduce a position, never create or increase.\n\n- **Order Retrieval**:  \n    When fetching open or historical orders, the `customerOrderId` (if specified during creation) and VALR's `orderId` will be returned.\n    \n- **Order Cancellation**:  \n    Use either `orderId` or `customerOrderId` to cancel an order—**not both**.\n    \n\n**Fee currency**\n\n- If you are a Maker and you are Buying BTC with USDT, your reward will be paid in USDT\n    \n- If you are a Maker and you are Selling BTC for USDT, your reward will be paid in BTC\n    \n- If you are a Taker and you are Buying BTC with USDT, your fee will be charged in BTC\n    \n- If you are a Taker and you are Selling BTC for USDT, your fee will be charged in USDT\n    \n\nIn short, fees will be in the currency that the taker is receiving and the maker is paying in the trade. The following example uses the `BTCUSDT` trading pair:\n\n| BTC/USDT | MAKER | TAKER | FEE/REWARD CURRENCY |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TRADE SIDE | BUY | SELL | USDT |\n| TRADE SIDE | SELL | BUY | BTC |\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**:\n\n- When you receive a `201 Created` response with an id, it means that the order has been successfully placed. You can use the Order Status REST API or use WebSocket API to receive the status of this order.\n    \n- When an order fails during the order placement process you can expect to receive an `orderId`, `code` and `message` in the response body. You can use the Order Status REST API or use WebSocket API to receive the status of this order.\n    \n\n``` json\n{\n    \"orderId\": \"d043a37d-40b0-49e5-b3fd-104c762585e7\",\n    \"code\": -6,\n    \"message\": \"Insufficient Balance\"\n}\n\n ```"

See explanation below. |\n| triggerType (required) | Can either be `LAST_TRADED` or `MARK_PRICE` |\n| pair (required) | The name of the perpetual futures contract expressed as base, quote, PERPe.g. BTCUSDTPERP |\n| takeProfitTriggerPrice (required for TP) | If Take Profit, the mark price or last traded price to trigger the conditional order. |\n| takeProfitOrderPrice (required for TP) | If Take Profit, the price at which the conditional order will be placed. |\n| stopLossTriggerPrice (required for SL) | If Stop Loss, the mark price or last traded price to trigger the conditional order. |\n| stopLossOrderPrice (required for SL) | If Stop Loss,The price at which the conditional order will be placed. |\n| customerOrderId (optional) | Alphanumeric value. See below for explanation. |\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n- **Quantity Behavior**:\n   - `quantity = 0`: Closes the entire open position.\n   - `quantity > 0`: Places a **reduce-only** order for the specified amount. If the quantity exceeds the current position, the system will use the open position's quantity.\n   - `quantity = -1`: Useful when adding to the position. Only closes the quantity added by the new order.\n\n- **Price Behavior**:\n   - `takeProfitOrderPrice = -1` or `stopLossOrderPrice = -1`: Places a market order. A limit order at the min/max slippage price is used to simulate the behavior of a market order.\n\n- **OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other)**:\n   - If both TP and SL are specified, the order is handled as **OCO**. Once one side triggers, the other is canceled.\n\n- **`customerOrderId`**:\n   - Must be unique across all open orders. Reusing an `id` from an active order results in the order being rejected. Use the order status API to check active orders.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: When you receive a response with an id, it does not always mean that the order has been placed. When the response is `202 Accepted`, you can use the Order Status REST API or use WebSocket API to receive the status of this order. The reasons why an order could fail are as follows:\n\n- Insufficient balance in your account.\n- If you're using a non-unique `customerOrderId`.\n- Self trading: If your order matches against your own order (on the other side).\n- Insufficient liquidity: If you're placing an order and there isn't liquidity to fulfill the order."

If `quoteAmount` is specified for a SELL order, your account will be credited with `quoteAmount` minus taker fees.  <br>2\\. If `baseAmount` is specified for a BUY order, your account will be credited with `baseAmount` minus taker fees.  <br>3\\. If `baseAmount` is provided, it will be truncated to `baseDecimalPlaces` of the currency pair. |\n| pair (required) | Can be `SOLUSDC`, `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `AVAXUSDT`. |\n| customerOrderId (optional) | Alphanumeric value. See below for explanation. |\n| allowMargin (optional) | `true` or `false`. Default value is `false`. See below for explanation. |\n| reduceOnly (optional) | `true` or `false`. Default value is `false`. See below for explanation. |\n| conditionalOrderData (optional) | Used on futures pairs to manage exposure through adding a Take Profit and/or Stop Loss (TPSL) to the order. See below for explanation. |\n\n**Notes**\n\n- **`customerOrderId`**:  \n    Optional field for tracking orders using your internal system. It supports alphanumeric characters and dashes (\"-\"), with a 50-character limit. Special characters are not allowed. The `customerOrderId` must be **unique across all open orders** for a given account. Reusing an `id` from an active order will prevent the new order from being placed (use the order status API to check an order’s status).\n\n- **`allowMargin`**:  \n    Set to `true` for margin/leverage trades. Only subaccounts can trade on margin, and each must be enabled individually via the account/status API.\n\n- **`reduceOnly`**:\n- Set to `true` for Perpetual Futures order(s) where the market order should only ever reduce a position, never create or increase.\n\n- **`conditionalOrderData`**:  \n    Conditional orders are used to add Take Profit and Stop Loss (TPSL) conditions to manage your futures Perpetual Futures order(s). These fields are used to define the conditions under which the TPSL will trigger, and how the order will be placed when triggered.\n\n    The key thing to note is that you do not need the `linkedOrderId` or `pair` because it refers to the market order that you are placing.\n\n    More information can be found in the [Conditional Orders Section](https://docs.valr.com/#8ab83b51-a0f7-405e-bc6b-b7e7f049544b).\n\n\n**Fee currency**\n\nWhen you place a market order, you will be charged the \"Taker fee\" on the trade.\n\n- As a Taker, if you are Buying BTC with ZAR, your fee will be charged in BTC\n    \n- As a Taker, if you are Selling BTC for ZAR, your fee will be charged in ZAR\n    \n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: When you receive a response with an id, it does not always mean that the order has been placed. When the response is `202 Accepted`, you can use the Order Status REST API or use WebSocket API to receive the status of this order. The reasons why an order could fail are as follows:\n\n- Insufficient balance in your account.\n    \n- If you're using a non-unique `customerOrderId`.\n    \n- If you set `postOnly` flag to true, but your order would have matched immediately.\n    \n- Self trading: If your order matches against your own order (on the other side).\n    \n- Insufficient liquidity: If you're placing an order and there isn't liquidity to fulfill the order."

See below for explanation. |\n| timeInForce (optional) | Can be `GTC`, `FOK` or `IOC`. `(should be upper case)` Default value is GTC. See below for explanation |\n\n**Notes**\n\n- **`customerOrderId`**:  \n    Optional field for tracking orders using your internal system. It supports alphanumeric characters and dashes (\"-\"), with a 50-character limit. Special characters are not allowed. The `customerOrderId` must be **unique across all open orders** for a given account. Reusing an `id` from an active order will prevent the new order from being placed (use the order status API to check an order’s status).\n    \n- **`allowMargin`**:  \n    Set to `true` for margin/leverage trades. Only subaccounts can trade on margin, and each must be enabled individually via the account/status API.\n\n- **Order Retrieval**:  \n    When fetching open or historical orders, the `customerOrderId` (if specified during creation) and VALR's `orderId` will be returned.\n    \n- **Order Cancellation**:  \n    Use either `orderId` or `customerOrderId` to cancel an order—**not both**.\n    \n\n**PLEASE NOTE**:\n\n- When you receive a `201 Created` response with an id, it means that the order has been successfully placed. You can use the Order Status REST API or use WebSocket API to receive the status of this order.\n- When an order fails during the order placement process you can expect to receive an `orderId`, `code` and `message` in the response body. See example below. You can use the Order Status REST API or use WebSocket API to receive the status of this order.\n    \n\n``` json\n{\n    \"orderId\": \"d043a37d-40b0-49e5-b3fd-104c762585e7\",\n    \"code\": -6,\n    \"message\": \"Insufficient Balance\"\n}\n\n ```"

						"description": "> Beta warning: This API is still in beta. This means that it may still undergo incompatible changes. \n  \n\nCreate a new Limit Order which will be repriced by 1 tick to the best bid or best ask (or by the \"postOnlyRepriceTicks\" value) if the specified price were to match. This ensures Limit Post Only Reprice orders are always placed, and execute as maker trades.\n\nThe JSON body used to create a limit order looks like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"side\": \"BUY\",\n    \"quantity\": \"0.0001\",\n    \"price\": \"656596\",\n    \"pair\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n    \"postOnlyReprice\": true,\n    \"postOnlyRepriceTicks\": \"1\",\n    \"customerOrderId\": \"Reprice1\",\n    \"timeInForce\": \"GTC\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| side (required) | `BUY` or `SELL` (must be uppercase) |\n| quantity (required) | Base amount (the amount submitted will be truncated to `baseDecimalPlaces` of the currency pair) |\n| price (required) | Price per coin in quote currency |\n| pair (required) | Must be a supported currency pair e.g., `SOLUSDC`, `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `AVAXUSDT`. |\n| postOnlyReprice (required) | `true` or `false`. Must be `true` for order repricing. |\n| postOnlyRepriceTicks (optional) | Numeric value (Default: `1`, Max: `50`). Number of ticks away from the other side of the book if the order were to match. |\n| customerOrderId (optional) | Alphanumeric value. See below for explanation. |\n| timeInForce (optional) | Can be `GTC`, `FOK`, or `IOC` (must be uppercase). Default value is `GTC`. See below for explanation. |\n\n---\n\n**Notes**\n\n- **`postOnlyReprice`**:  \n    Must be `true` for the order to reprice if the order matches as it's placed.\n\n- **`postOnlyRepriceTicks`**:  \n    The number of ticks away from the other side of the book if the order were to match. Default value is `1`, Max is `50`.\n\n- **`customerOrderId`**:  \n    An optional field which can be specified by clients to track this order using their own internal order management systems. It supports alphanumeric characters and dashes (\"-\"), with a 50-character limit. Special characters are not allowed. The `customerOrderId` must be **unique across all open orders** for a given account. Reusing an `id` from an active order will prevent the new order from being placed (use the order status API to check an order’s status).\n\n- **`postOnly`**:  \n    Setting `postOnly=true` will place a Maker order and cause it to fail if it is matched immediately.\n\n- **`timeInForce`**:  \n    Specifies the duration that an order will remain active. Post only reprice orders have to use `GTC`.\n\n- **Order Retrieval**:  \n    When you retrieve open orders or order history, the `customerOrderId` (if specified during creation) and VALR's `orderId` will both be returned.\n\n- **Order Cancellation**:  \n    You can cancel an order by specifying either `orderId` or `customerOrderId`, but **not both**.\n\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: When you receive a response with an id,  \nit does not always mean that the order has been placed.  \nWhen the response is `202 Accepted`, you can use the  \nOrder Status REST API or use WebSocket API to receive the status  \nof this order. The reasons why an order could fail are as follows:\n\n- Insufficient balance in your account.\n    \n- If you're using a non-unique `customerOrderId`.\n    \n- Self trading: If your order matches against your own order (on the other side).\n    \n- Insufficient liquidity: If you're placing an order and there isn't liquidity to fulfil the order."

The parameters will be interpreted as being in the UTC time zone and must be supplied in the ISO 8601 format (`2023-10-29T22:00:00.000Z`). These two parameters may be used together or separately. When `startTime` is used, orders that have occurred since `startTime` are returned. When `endTime` is used, orders that have occurred up to and including `endTime` are returned.\n\nIn addition `startTime` and `endTime` can be used in conjunction with `skip` and `limit`. When specified together you will be able to paginate the result within the time range specified.\n\nExample:\n\n- `startTime` specified as `2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z`\n    \n- `endTime` specified as `2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z`\n    \n- `skip` specified as 0 and `limit` 100\n    \n\nThis will example will return the most recent 100 orders between the `startTime` and `endTime`\n\nThe `statuses` parameter may be used to filter the returned items by a comma-separated list of statuses from the following list of supported order statuses:\n\n- PLACED\n    \n- FAILED\n    \n- CANCELLED\n    \n- FILLED\n    \n- PARTIALLY_FILLED\n    \n- ACTIVE\n    \n- EXPIRED\n    \n- PARTIALLY_FILLED_DUE_TO_SLIPPAGE\n    \n- ORDER_MODIFIED\n    \n\n## Filtering by `currencyPair`\n\nThe `currencyPair` parameter may be used to filter the returned items by the currency pair symbol (Example: `BTCUSDC`, `SOLUSDC` etc.).\n\n## Additional filters `showZeroVolumeCancels & excludeFailures`\n\nThe `showZeroVolumeCancels` parameter can be used to toogle cancelled orders that did not match. The default value is `false`.\n\nSetting the `excludeFailures` parameter to `true` will filter failed orders from the returned items. The default value is `false`."

We urge you to share any suggestions by logging a quick Feature Request on our [Support Portal](https://support.valr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000447220)\n\nThe following values of an open or partially filled limit order can be modified.\n\n- Price\n    \n- Total Quantity\n    \n- Remaining Quantity\n    \n\n- Either newRemainingQuantity or newTotalQuantity can be specified in the same request, but not both\n    \n- Reducing the Total quantity or Remaining quantity will maintain the modified order’s position in the order queue.\n    \n- Increasing the Total quantity or Remaining quantity will move the modified order to the back of the order queue.\n    \n- Modifying the price up or down will move the modified order to the back of the order queue.\n    \n\nModified orders retain their original orderId and the audit trail can be viewed in the Detailed Order History API Call\n\nWhen the response is `202 - Accepted`, this means that the `Modify Order` request has been submitted. However, this does not always mean that the order has been modified as requested.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| orderId (required) | Placed order Id provided by VALR |\n| pair (required) | Currency pair for the `orderId`. |\n| modifyMatchStrategy (required) | `RETAIN_ORIGINAL` which keeps the original order or `CANCEL_ORIGINAL` to cancel the original order or `REPRICE` which if it would’ve resulted in a match, instead adjusts the order price to 1 tick below best ask (buy order) or 1 tick above best bid (sell order) |\n| newRemainingQuantity (optional) | New base quantity to be executed, irrespective of any existing quantity on the order book at the time of processing the request |\n| newTotalQuantity (optional) | New total base quantity for the order. If newTotalQuantity is less than the filled quantity, the order is canceled.

						"description": "Modify a batch of open and partially filled Limit Orders in a single request.\n\n**Note:** This API is still in Beta phase but stable. We would love to improve the user experience with your feedback. We urge you to share any suggestions by logging a quick Feature Request on our [Support Portal](https://support.valr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000447220)\n\nThe following values of an open or partially filled limit order can be modified.\n\n- Price\n- Total Quantity\n- Remaining Quantity\n    \n\n- Either newRemainingQuantity or newTotalQuantity can be specified in the same request, but not both\n- Reducing the Total quantity or Remaining quantity will maintain the modified order’s position in the order queue.\n- Increasing the Total quantity or Remaining quantity will move the modified order to the back of the order queue.\n- Modifying the price up or down will move the modified order to the back of the order queue.\n    \n\nModified orders retain their original orderId and the audit trail can be viewed in the Detailed Order History API Call\n\nWhen the response is `202 - Accepted`, this means that the `Modify Order` request has been submitted. However, this does not always mean that the order has been modified as requested.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| type (required) | MODIFY_ORDER |\n| orderId (required) | Placed order Id provided by VALR |\n| pair (required) | Currency pair for the `orderId`. |\n| modifyMatchStrategy (required) | `RETAIN_ORIGINAL` which keeps the original order or `CANCEL_ORIGINAL` to cancel the original order |\n| newRemainingQuantity (optional) | Requested new base quantity to be executed |\n| newTotalQuantity (optional) | Requested new total quantity to be executed |\n| newPrice (optional) | Requested new price in base currency |\n| customerOrderId (optional) | Placed order ID provided by customer. Alphanumeric with no special chars, limit of 50 characters. |\n\n- `customerOrderId` has to be unique across all open orders for a given account. If you do reuse an `id` value that is currently an active open order, your order will not be placed (you can check the status of an order using the order status API call).\n- When you retrieve `All Open Orders` or `Order History` the `customerOrderId` field will also be returned along with the VALR's `orderId` for the orders in which this field was specified in the request.\n    \n\nThe reasons why a Modify Order request could fail are as follows:\n\n- Insufficient balance in your account.\n- If you're using a non-unique `customerOrderId`.\n- Self trading: If your order matches against your own order (on the other side).\n- Insufficient liquidity: If you're placing an order and there isn't enough liquidity on the order book to fulfil the order.\n- Minimum order size is not met. In this case, the response will be `accepted:false`, with the failure reason.\n- When there is nothing to modify, i.e. you request the same values as specified in the original order."

However, the V2 API will return `201 Created` whenever the order was successfully placed/modified on the order book and`200 Ok` when successfully cancelled.

Please see our fees for clarity on how simple orders and simple swaps are billed.\n\nThis API is protected and will require authentication. See the section on `Authentication` to learn how to authenticate your API calls.\n\n#### API Key Requirements\n\nThe API key used to get brokerage quotes and place brokerage instructions will require `Trade` and `Internal Transfer` permissions. This is due to the brokerage instructions being a two part process with a simple order / simple swap followed by an internal transfer of the brokerage fee into the fee account."

(Beta) |\n\n### MARGIN_INFO\n\nIn order to subscribe to the **MARGIN_INFO** event, you must send the following message on the `Account` WebSocket connection once it is opened:\n\n``` json\n{ \n  \"type\": \"SUBSCRIBE\", \n  \"subscriptions\": [\n    { \n      \"event\":\"MARGIN_INFO\" \n    }\n  ] \n}\n\n ```\n\nOn subscription the latest update is sent immediately.\n\nYou can unsubscribe from `MARGIN_INFO`, `BALANCE_UPDATE` and `OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE` events. To unsubscribe, send an `UNSUBSCRIBE` message listing the event types to unsubscribe from.\n\nFor example, to unsubscribe from all three supported events, send this message:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"UNSUBSCRIBE\",\n  \"requests\": [\n    {\n      \"event\": \"MARGIN_INFO\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"event\": \"BALANCE_UPDATE\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"event\": \"OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n ```\n\n## Message Feeds (On `Account` WebSocket)\n\nAs soon as the connection is established, the client is automatically subscribed to all events on the `Account` WebSocket connection. If needed, the client can unsubscribe from any events as described below.\n\nOn connection and authentication to the `Account` WebSocket we will now send all account balances, open orders and positions associated with the user account. We will send one **BALANCE_UPDATE** message for each asset held and one **OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE** message containing all open orders by the account, across all order books.\nUsers can also unsubscribe from these by following the example provided above.\n\nHere is a list of events that occur on the `Account` WebSocket and the corresponding sample message feed:\n\n### NEW_ACCOUNT_HISTORY_RECORD :

reduced by 0.0081 BTC. At the same time a new order was placed at 46125 USDC selling 0.0418 BTC. There was no change to the Bids.\n\n##### Rules for updating the order book\n\n1. Start with the full order book snapshot\n    \n2. When an update is received, for each included order:\n    \n3. If the order quantity is `\"0\"`, remove the order with the given `\"orderId\"` from the order book if it exists\n    \n4. Else, update the order quantity if it already exists, or add the new order to the price level indicated by the `\"Price\"` field\n    \n\n**Calculating the Checksum value**\n\nTo confirm the integrity of the order book data, an unsigned crc32 checksum is sent in each **FULL_ORDERBOOK_UPDATE** message.\n\nThe `Checksum` is verified by taking the 25 best bids and the 25 best asks and concatenating a string with the best bid order ID, followed by the quantity, followed by the same for the best ask, then the next best bid, etc. Separate each value by a colon (`:`) and calculate the unsigned CRC32 hash.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n``` javascript\nconst CRC = require(\"crc/crc32\");\nconst calculateCRC32 = (orderBook) => {\n  const selectBestOrders = (side) => {\n    const list = [];\n    for (const priceLevel of side) {\n      for (const order of priceLevel.Orders) {\n        if (list.length === 25) return list;\n        list.push(`${order.orderId}:${order.quantity}`);\n      }\n    }\n    return list;\n  };\n  const bids = selectBestOrders(orderBook.Bids);\n  const asks = selectBestOrders(orderBook.Asks);\n  const orders = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 25; i++) {\n    if (bids[i]) orders.push(bids[i]);\n    if (asks[i]) orders.push(asks[i]);\n  }\n  return CRC.unsigned(orders.join(\":\"));\n};\n\n ```\n\n**Calculating the next expected sequence number**\n\nTo confirm that no **FULL_ORDERBOOK_UPDATE** message was missed, the next expected sequence number can be calculated by adding the number of orders in an update (including \"0\" quantity updates, which removes orders) to the previous sequence number and comparing it to the number in the current message. Because an order may be partially matched one or more times before being filled or cancelled, the update message may include multiple updates of the same order.\n\n---\n\n### OB_L1_DIFF\n\n##### OB_L1_SNAPSHOT\n\nAfter subscribing to **OB_L1_DIFF** for a currency pair, one snapshot of the order book for the currency pair will be sent.\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"OB_L1_SNAPSHOT\",\n  \"ps\": \"BTCUSDC\",         // Currency pair symbol\n  \"d\": {                   // Data\n    \"lc\": 1644301604645,   // Last Change\n    \"a\": [                 // Asks\n      [\n        \"45363\",           // Price\n        \"0.01102078\"       // Total quantity at price level\n      ],\n      [\"45662\",\"0.0018\"],\n      [\"45891\",\"0.0038\"],\n      [\"46584\",\"0.0018\"],\n      [\"46613\",\"0.0437\"],\n      [\"47052\",\"0.002\"],\n      [\"47288\",\"0.0019\"],\n      [\"49998\",\"0.0644\"],\n      [\"54000\",\"0.0019\"],\n      // Orders omitted for brevity\n    ],\n    \"b\": [                 // Bids\n      [\"45147\",\"0.011\"],\n      [\"45121\",\"0.00169\"],\n      [\"44809\",\"0.0694\"],\n      [\"44756\",\"0.0018\"],\n      [\"44667\",\"0.0506\"],\n      [\"42719\",\"0.125\"],\n      [\"42500\",\"0.0002\"],\n      [\"40552\",\"0.0263\"]\n      // Price levels omitted for brevity\n    ],\n    \"sq\": 589628102,       // Sequence number\n    \"cs\": 4146165992       // Checksum\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n##### OB_L1_DIFF\n\nAfter receiving the **OB_L1_SNAPSHOT**, updates to the order book will be sent in **OB_L1_DIFF** messages.\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"OB_L1_DIFF\",\n  \"ps\": \"BTCUSDC\",           // Currency pair symbol\n  \"d\": {                     // Data\n    \"lc\": 1644303209930,     // Last Change\n    \"a\": [                   // Asks\n      [\n        \"45363\",             // Price\n        \"0.00102078\"         // Total current quantity at price level\n      ],\n      [\"46125\",\"0.0418\"],\n      [\"46126\",\"0\"],         // Quantity of 0 indicates price level can be removed\n    ],\n    \"b\": [],                 // Bids\n    \"sq\": 589628111,         // Sequence number\n    \"cs\": 604745093          // Checksum\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\nIn this update, the total quantity of orders at price level `45363` and `46125` were updated and all orders at price level `46126` were removed.\n\n##### Rules for updating the order book\n\n1.

Supported: D1, D5, D10, D20, D40, D80.\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"OB_L1_D1_SNAPSHOT\",\n  \"ps\": \"BTCUSDC\",         // Currency pair symbol\n  \"d\": {                   // Data\n    \"lc\": 1644301604645,   // Last Change\n    \"a\": [                 // Asks\n      [\n        \"45363\",           // Price\n        \"0.01102078\"       // Total quantity at price level\n      ],\n      // Order book side will be truncated to specified depth\n    ],\n    \"b\": [                 // Bids\n      [\"45147\",\"0.011\"],\n    ],\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n### MARKET_SUMMARY_UPDATE\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"MARKET_SUMMARY_UPDATE\",\n  \"currencyPairSymbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n  \"data\": { \n        \"currencyPair\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n        \"askPrice\": \"297357\",\n        \"bidPrice\": \"297205\",\n        \"lastTradedPrice\": \"297161\",\n        \"previousClosePrice\": \"296596\",\n        \"baseVolume\": \"244.33584689486\",\n        \"highPrice\": \"300180\",\n        \"lowPrice\": \"281930\",\n        \"created\": \"2022-11-14T08:30:26.037Z\",\n        \"changeFromPrevious\": \"0.19\",\n        \"markPrice\": \"297205\"\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n### NEW_TRADE_BUCKET\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"NEW_TRADE_BUCKET\",\n  \"currencyPairSymbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"currencyPairSymbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n    \"bucketPeriodInSeconds\": 60,\n    \"startTime\": \"2019-04-25T19:41:00Z\",\n    \"open\": \"9500\",\n    \"high\": \"9500\",\n    \"low\": \"9500\",\n    \"close\": \"9500\",\n    \"volume\": \"0\"\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n### NEW_TRADE\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"NEW_TRADE\",\n  \"currencyPairSymbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"price\": \"9500\",\n    \"quantity\": \"0.001\",\n    \"currencyPair\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n    \"tradedAt\": \"2019-04-25T19:51:55.393Z\",\n    \"takerSide\": \"buy\"\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n### MARK_PRICE_UPDATE\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"type\": \"MARK_PRICE_UPDATE\",\n    \"currencyPairSymbol\": \"BTCUSDTPERP\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"price\": \"33000\"\n    }\n}\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n### PNL_RUN_COMPLETED\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"PNL_RUN_COMPLETED\",\n  \"currencyPairSymbol\": \"BTCUSDTPERP\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"price\": \"116048\"\n  }\n}\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n### FUNDING_RUN_COMPLETED\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"FUNDING_RUN_COMPLETED\",\n  \"currencyPairSymbol\": \"BTCUSDTPERP\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n### ALLOWED_ORDER_TYPES_UPDATED\n\nSample message feed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"ALLOWED_ORDER_TYPES_UPDATED\",\n  \"currencyPairSymbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n  \"data\": [\n    \"STOP_LOSS_LIMIT\",\n    \"TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT\",\n    \"LIMIT\",\n    \"LIMIT_POST_ONLY\",\n    \"SIMPLE\",\n    \"MARKET\"\n  ]\n}\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n## Unsubscribing from events\n\nWhen you are no longer interested in receiving messages for certain events on the `Trade` WebSocket connection, you can send a synthetic \"unsubscribe\" message.

			"description": "## Overview\n\nThe WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between a client and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.\n\nPlease note that all unauthenticated WebSocket connections are automatically closed after 15 minutes regardless of activity.\n\nYou can read more about WebSockets [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).\n\n---\n\n## Connection\n\n### URL\n\nOur WebSocket API is accessible on the following address:\n\n<a href=\"null\">wss://api.valr.com</a>\n\n- **Account WebSocket connection**: In order to receive streaming updates about your VALR account, you would open up a WebSocket connection to\n    \n    <a href=\"null\">wss://api.valr.com/ws/account</a>\n    \n- **Trade WebSocket connection**: In order to receive streaming updates about Trade data, you would open up a WebSocket connection to\n    \n    <a href=\"null\">wss://api.valr.com/ws/trade</a>\n    \n\n### Connecting using NodeJS\n\nThere are various WebSocket libraries that one can use to interact with our WebSocket API, depending on your choice of programming language and development framework. In NodeJS, you can use a popular library called [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) for authentication, establishing a connection and to receive live updates.\n\nYou can use the following command to install the `ws` package to your NodeJS project:\n\n`npm install ws`\n\nOnce `ws` is installed, you can authenticate and establish a connection to our API with the following code:\n\n``` javascript\nconst WebSocket = require('ws')\nvar headers = getAuthHeaders('/ws/account')\n// Authenticate and establish a connection\nconst ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.valr.com/ws/account', { headers })\nws.on('open', () =>  {\n    // you can now start working with the connection\n})\nws.on('message', data =>  {\n    // work with data\n})\nws.on('error', err => {\n    // handle error\n})\nws.on('close', () => {\n    // reconnect if needed\n})\n\n ```\n\nOnce authenticated, and the connection is established, the code above listens to the `open`, `message`, `error` and `close` events emitted from the server. The relevant payload will be available for each of these events. The one that is most interesting is the `data` payload on the `message` event. You will make use of this payload when receiving and working with live message updates.\n\n---\n\n## Authentication\n\nOur WebSocket API requires authentication. To authenticate, add the following headers to the first call that establishes the WebSocket connection.\n\n- **X-VALR-API-KEY**: Your API Key\n    \n- **X-VALR-SIGNATURE**: Generated signature. The signature is generated using the following parameters:\n    \n    - Api Secret\n        \n    - Timestamp of request\n        \n    - HTTP verb 'GET'\n        \n    - Path (either `/ws/account` or `/ws/trade`)\n        \n    - Request Body should be empty\n        \n- **X-VALR-TIMESTAMP**: Timestamp of the request\n    \n\nLike this for `Account` WebSocket (in NodeJS):\n\n`const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.valr.com/ws/account', { headers })`\n\nOr, if you want to connect to the `Trade` WebSocket, you would use the appropriate path:\n\n`const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.valr.com/ws/trade', { headers })`\n\nThe headers that are passed to establish the connection are the same 3 headers you pass to any authenticated call to the REST API. Here's how you would populate these headers:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction getAuthHeaders(path) {\n    var headers = new Object()\n    var timestamp = (new Date()).getTime()\n    var signature = signRequest(apiKeySecret, timestamp, 'GET', path, '')\n    headers['X-VALR-API-KEY'] = apiKey\n    headers[\"X-VALR-SIGNATURE\"] = signature\n    headers['X-VALR-TIMESTAMP'] = timestamp\n    return headers\n}\n\n ```\n\nThe `signRequest` method is repeated below for your convenience:\n\n``` javascript\nconst crypto = require(\"crypto\")\nfunction signRequest(apiKeySecret, timestamp, verb, path, body = \"\") {\n  return crypto\n    .createHmac(\"sha512\", apiKeySecret)\n    .update(timestamp.toString())\n    .update(verb.toUpperCase())\n    .update(path)\n    .update(body)\n    .digest(\"hex\")\n}\n\n ```\n\nThe `signRequest` method requires the `crypto` package. You can use the following command to install the `crypto` package to your NodeJS project:\n\n`npm install crypto`\n\n### Putting it all together\n\nIn NodeJS, your code to establish an authenticated connection to our WebSocket API and start listening to message feeds would look like this:\n\n``` javascript\nconst crypto = require(\"crypto\")\nconst WebSocket = require(\"ws\")\nconst apiKey = \"yourapikey\"\nconst apiKeySecret = \"yourapikeysecret\"\nfunction signRequest(apiKeySecret, timestamp, verb, path, body = \"\") {\n  return crypto\n    .createHmac(\"sha512\", apiKeySecret)\n    .update(timestamp.toString())\n    .update(verb.toUpperCase())\n    .update(path)\n    .update(body)\n    .digest(\"hex\")\n}\nfunction getAuthHeaders(path) {\n  var headers = new Object()\n  var timestamp = new Date().getTime()\n  var signature = signRequest(apiKeySecret, timestamp, \"GET\", path, \"\")\n  headers[\"X-VALR-API-KEY\"] = apiKey\n  headers[\"X-VALR-SIGNATURE\"] = signature\n  headers[\"X-VALR-TIMESTAMP\"] = timestamp\n  return headers\n}\n// Account WebSocket connection\nfunction connectToAccount() {\n    var headers = getAuthHeaders('/ws/account')\n    const wsAccount = new WebSocket('wss://api.valr.com/ws/account', { headers })\n    wsAccount.on(\"open\", () => {\n        // you can now start working with the connection\n        console.log(\"Account WS connected\");\n    })\n    wsAccount.on(\"message\", data => {\n        // work with data\n    })\n    wsAccount.on(\"error\", err => {\n        // handle error\n    })\n    wsAccount.on(\"close\", () => {\n        // reconnect if needed\n    })\n}\n// Trade WebSocket connection\nfunction connectToTrade() {\n    var headers = getAuthHeaders(\"/ws/trade\")\n    const wsTrade = new WebSocket('wss://api.valr.com/ws/trade', { headers })\n    wsTrade.on(\"open\", () => {\n      // you can now start working with the connection\n      console.log('Trade WS connected')\n    })\n    wsTrade.on(\"message\", data => {\n      // work with data\n    })\n    wsTrade.on(\"error\", err => {\n      // handle error\n    })\n    wsTrade.on(\"close\", () => {\n      // reconnect if needed\n    })\n}\nconnectToAccount()\nconnectToTrade()\n\n ```\n\n---\n\n## Subscribing to events\n\nOnce you open a connection to `Account`, you are automatically subscribed to all messages for all events on the `Account` WebSocket connection. You will start receiving message feeds pertaining to your VALR account. For example, you will receive messages when your balance is updated or when a new trade is executed on your account.\n\nOn the other hand, when you open a connection to `Trade`, in order to receive message feeds about trading data, you must subscribe to events you are interested in on the `Trade` WebSocket connection. For example, if you want to receive messages when markets fluctuate, you must send a message on the connection with the following payload:\n\n``` javascript\nvar message = {\n  \"type\": \"SUBSCRIBE\",\n  \"subscriptions\": [\n    {\n      \"event\": \"MARKET_SUMMARY_UPDATE\",\n      \"pairs\": [\n        \"BTCUSDT\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n} \nws.on('open', ()) =>  {\n    // Once the connection is open, you subscribe to an event here\n    ws.send(JSON.stringify(message))\n})\n\n ```\n\nHere, the event you are subscribing to is called **MARKET_SUMMARY_UPDATE** and the currency pairs you are subscribing to is an array.\n\n---\n\n## Unsubscribing from events\n\nWhen you are no longer interested in receiving messages for certain events on the `Trade` WebSocket connection, you can send a synthetic \"unsubscribe\" message. For example, if you want to unsubscribe from **MARKET_SUMMARY_UPDATE** event, you would send a message as follows:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"SUBSCRIBE\",\n  \"subscriptions\": [\n    {\n      \"event\": \"MARKET_SUMMARY_UPDATE\",\n      \"pairs\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n ```\n\nHere, since the **pairs** array is empty, you will be unsubscribed from any existing subscriptions you might have had to any currency pair market updates.\n\n---\n\n## Staying connected with Ping-Pong messages\n\nTo ensure that you stay connected to either the `Account` or `Trade` WebSocket you must send a \"PING\" message every 30 seconds on the WebSocket you wish to monitor. VALR will respond with a **PONG** event. The message must be as follows:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"PING\"\n}\n\n ```\n\nOn the `Trade` WebSocket the **PONG** message body will be \"NO_SUBSCRIPTIONS\" if you are not subscribed to any message types.\n\n---",

We achieve this by gradually selling off assets when the account falls below maintenance margin.\n\nThe Liquidation process is set up in distinct stages that aim to keep an account above maintenance margin for as long as possible, reducing the impact of liquidation orders on order books and allowing customers the opportunity to take action to repay debt.\n\nAll liquidation orders placed during the first stage (i.e. below maintenance but above auto-close, and whether matcher or not) will be visible as orders of the type \"liquidation limit order\" on the particular account in question.\n\nSimilarly, for auto-close, the transfer of debt and assets out of the account will be visible on transaction history records as \"liquidation takeover debt transfer\" and \"liquidation takeover asset transfer\" respectively."

The `skip` and `limit` parameters may be applied to paginate the filtered results.\n\n## Filtering by `currencyPair`\n\nThe `currencyPair` parameter may be used to filter the returned items by name of the perpetual futures contract expressed as base, quote, PERPe.g. BTCUSDTPERP|\n\n## Filtering by `startTime` or `endTime`\n\nThe `startTime` or `endTime` parameters may be used to filter the returned items by the transaction date. The parameters will be interpreted as being in the UTC time zone and must be supplied in the ISO 8601 format (`2023-11-14T22:00:00.000Z`). These two parameters may be used together or separately. When `startTime` is used, transactions that have occurred since `startTime` are returned. When `endTime` is used, transactions that have occurred up to and including `endTime` are returned.  \nWhen not specified, 30 days worth of transactions are returned by default."

			"description": "Make use of our Margin API to view in real time vital information for accounts with leverage positions.\n\nThese APIs are protected and will require authentication. See the section on `Authentication` to learn how to authenticate your API calls.\n\n**Futures Overview**\n\nFutures trading is available to qualifying customers by jurisdiction.\n\nA specific subaccount with futures trading enabled is cross-collateralised (cross margin), meaning that all assets within that subaccount that qualify as collateral (i.e. have a collateral weighting greater than zero) count towards account equity and can be used to collateralise futures positions. These assets will be called upon to settle position PnL in the event of liquidation.\n\nFutures positions are currently one directional on VALR, meaning that a single account cannot hold both a long and short position for the same contract simultaneously. If you wish to hold positions in both directions, please split positions into different subaccounts.\n\nAny number of subaccounts can be created and enabled for futures trading.\nAdditional Futures information: https://support.valr.com/hc/en-us/articles/11078306427420-Perpetual-Futures-Trading-Guide\n\nAdditional Margin requirement information: https://support.valr.com/hc/en-us/articles/7531495382940-Margin-Trading-Guide\n\nShould an account fall below maintenance margin, liquidation is triggered. VALR's liquidation engine is designed to bring an account below maintenance margin back to a healthy state, measured as recovering to above maintenance margin. The liquidation engine aims to carefully close down positions in the market, while minimising market impact and keeping markets orderly.\n\nWhen an account's margin falls below maintenance margin, Stage 1 liquidation automatically triggers. Futures positions are closed piecemeal until the account is back above maintenance margin.\n\nStage 2 liquidation is triggered if an account falls below auto-close margin. In stage 2, account positions are fully closed through auto-deleveraging (ADL). The consequence is that the trader loses their entire equity collateral for that account if that account falls below auto-close.\n\nVALR holds an insurance fund as a final backstop for positions that are bankrupt."

Bundles are **pre-configured** and **rebalanced automatically** based on parameters set by the fund manager (e.g., monthly).\n\nNew API Endpoints\n\n- **POST** `/v1/bundles/buy` – Purchase a bundle on the primary market  \n- **POST** `/v1/bundles/sell` – Sell a bundle on the primary market  \n- **GET** `/v1/bundles/transactions?bundleSymbol=` – List primary market transactions for a specific bundle\n- **GET** `/v1/bundles/all` – Retrieve all bundles and their current market details\n\n\n**30 October 2025**\n\n- Users are now able to unsubscribe from these Account WebSocket events:\n    \n    - `BALANCE_UPDATE`\n        \n    - `OPEN_ORDERS_UPDATE`\n        \n    - `MARGIN_INFO`\n        \n\n**12 August 2025**\n\n- Added suggestions for alternate methods on the public API description\n    \n\n**24 July 2025**\n\nREST API Changes\n\n- Update to GET route `GET /v1/positions/open`, will now contain a new field `leverageTier` which indicates the leverage tier for each open position.\n    \n\nWebSocket Messages\n\n- Update to the existing WS `OPEN_POSITION_UPDATE`, will now contain a new field `leverageTier` which indicates the leverage tier for each open position.\n    \n- New WS `PNL_RUN_COMPLETED`, sent when a PNL (Profit and Loss) run is completed for subscribed currency pairs.\n    \n- New WS `FUNDING_RUN_COMPLETED`, sent when a funding run is completed for subscribed currency pairs.\n    \n- New WS `LEVERAGE_UPDATED`, while subscribed to this, the user will receive real time updates when the leverage is changed for a currency pair.\n    \n\n**8 July 2025**\n\n- Added a new GET Price Buckets for a currency pair endpoint (`https://api.valr.com/v1/public/:currencyPair/buckets`). This API provides historical market data aggregated into time-based \"buckets\" (candles) for a specified currency pair and bucket period.\n    \n- Each bucket returned includes `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, and `quoteVolume` for the defined time interval.\n    \n- The `periodSeconds` query parameter supports values of 60 (default), 300, 900, 1800, 3600, 21600, and 86400 (maximum).\n    \n- Introduced an optional `includeEmpty` query parameter (defaulting to `false`) to include buckets where no trading activity occurred. For such buckets, `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` prices will be identical (reflecting the last traded price), and `volume` and `quoteVolume` will be zero.\n    \n\n**3 July 2025**\n\n- Added detail about the automatic pruning of unauthenticated WebSocket connections.\n    \n\n**29 May 2025**\n\n- Updated the documentation for the GET route `/v1/account/transactionhistory?skip=0&limit=100&transactionTypes=SIMPLE_BUY,LIMIT_BUY,MARKET_BUY¤cy=ZAR&startTime=2020-02-29T22:00:00.000Z&endTime=2021-04-30T21:59:59.999Z` to include the following transaction types:\n    \n    - `FUND`\n        \n    - `FIAT_WITHDRAWAL_FEE_REVERSAL`\n        \n    - `CREDIT_CARD_DEPOSIT`\n        \n    - `SPOT_BORROW_INTEREST_CHARGE`\n        \n    - `SPOT_LEND_INTEREST_PAYMENT`\n        \n    - `LIQUIDATION_LIMIT_BUY`\n        \n    - `LIQUIDATION_LIMIT_SELL`\n        \n    - `LIQUIDATION_TAKEOVER_ASSET_TRANSFER`\n        \n    - `LIQUIDATION_TAKEOVER_DEBT_TRANSFER`\n        \n    - `FUTURES_FUNDING_EARNED`\n        \n    - `FUTURES_FUNDING_PAID`\n        \n    - `FUTURES_PNL_PROFIT`\n        \n    - `FUTURES_PNL_LOSS`\n        \n    - `FUTURES_TRADE_FEE`\n        \n    - `COLLATERAL_CONVERSION_LIMIT_BUY`\n        \n    - `COLLATERAL_CONVERSION_LIMIT_SELL`\n        \n- Added a GET and PUT route `/v1/margin/leverage/:currencypair` to the `Futures` folder.
